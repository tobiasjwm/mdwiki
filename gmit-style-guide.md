# GlobalMac IT Style guide #


## Technical Writing ##


### Getting Started ###

Members of the technical group are encouraged, often required, to write for GlobalMac IT. This writing can include system documentation, process documentation, client training sheets and blog posts. 

For maximum compatibility, simplicity of writing and portability, members of the technical team will create all documents in [plain text][1] format using [Markdown][2] to provide styling metadata. 

**Plain Text.** *.txt* is the preferred format with *.md* being an acceptable substitute. 

**Markdown.** *.md* should be used when creating documentation for any projects being published at GitHub. 

### Presentation ###

- Headings (and how they are capitalized)
- Lists (whether they are capitalized and how they are punctuated)
- Numbers (when they should be spelled in full)
- Rules for chapter, figure and table headings (including numbering)

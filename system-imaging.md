# System Software and Management Tools


## Deployment Tools


### AutoDMG

Create a golden master OS X installer really quickly. Accepts drag-and-drop of Install OS X.app and any other packages your want installed on a master image. Be aware that not all software (I'm looking at you Microsoft Office) Likes to be installed before a first boot. For that, we have [first-boot-pkg](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg).

## System Management Tools


### scriptRunner

Run scripts automatically. Has two functions: "once" and "every". Place a script in one of those loactions to run automatically. It requires a LaunchAgent to fire it up. [Lingon X](https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/) is a great way to create the LaunchAgent.
